# How to build GLFW on Mac OSX 10.13

- install cmake.
- download source from here - http://www.glfw.org/download.html
- extract zip file and move directory to something like `~/dev/native_dependencies/`.  After doing this, my path is `~/dev/native_dependencies/glfw-3.2.1`.


- compile notes here - http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html
